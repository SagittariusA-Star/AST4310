She applied the newly derived Saha distribution for different ionisation stages of an element to stellar spectra, finding that the empirical Harvard classification represents primarily a temperature scale. Her work crowned efforts of Saha, Russell, Fowler, Milne, Pannekoek and others along the same lines. It illustrates that detailed physics, in this case atomic physics, is usually needed to explain cosmic phenomena.\n",
