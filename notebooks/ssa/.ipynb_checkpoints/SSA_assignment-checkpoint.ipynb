The Lyman lines have a smaller wavelength, and the Paschen and Bracket lines have too large wavelengths to appear in the spectrogram. Thus the only hydrogen lines we can see are the H$\\beta$, H$\\gamma$, H$\\delta$ and H$\\epsilon$ lines. However, the H$\\gamma$, H$\\delta$ and H$\\epsilon$ lines are not drawn in the level diagram, but they are still there. All the Balmer lines share the same lower level at $s = 2$ .

By increasing the temperature $T$ the temperature dependence of the Boltzmann equation thus drops away as $\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\chi_{r,s}}{kT}\\right]\\to 1$ for $T\\to\\infty$. While the additional factor $T^{3/2}$ grows faster than $\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\chi_{r,s}}{kT}\\right]$ as $T\\to\\infty$, making the Saha distribution diverge.

Therefore the fraction between the number density $\\frac{N_{r+1}}{N_r}\\to\\infty$ of ionisation stage $r$ and $r+1$. Thus $N_{r+1}$ is infinitly larger than $N_r$ or $N_r\\to 0$, meaning that no more atoms are in the lower ionisation stage $r$. If we do this for all possible $r$ we see that for $T\\to\\infty$ we fully deplete the lower ionisation stages, removing all electrons from the atom. \n",

Thus for increasing levels $s$, the energy $\\chi_{r,s}$ increases, making the exponential factor decrease the population fraction $\\frac{n_{r,s}}{N_r}$. Increasing the temperature the Boltzmann populations will eventually flatten out for all the levels $s$. From this we can thus see that there is allways an exponential drop-off in the number of atoms being in the higher exited levels, meaning exitation can at most put a few atoms in the higher exited states.

Also we see that He, only having three stages; He I, He II and HeIII, has all its possible stages represented. Therewhile the Ca atom only shows six (Ca I - Ca V) of its 21 possible stages (which are probably quite hard to find when searching for the higher stages). Another difference to note is that it seems as if He II reaches its population peak at arround 25 kK, while at the same temperature Ca III also reaches its population peak. This may suggest that it is a bit easier to ionize Ca one stage higher than it is to ionize He to the same stage."

    "Calculating and print out the partition functions $U_r$ for the provided Hydrogen atom model data in `H_atom.txt` and the calculated 100-level Hydrogen atom model saved in the `H_model.dat`-file, we see that they behave quite similar for low temperatures. At low temperatures (5000 K) both $U_1 = 2$ and $U_2 = 1$. for each model. However, when increasing the temperature to 10000 K we start to notice that $U_1$ remains close to $U_1 \\approx 2$ for the provided model and approaches $U_1 = 2.1$ for the calculated level 100-level model. Increasing the temperature even more to 20000 K, we see the differences become very evident. Now the partition function $U_1 \\approx 2.1$ for the provided model, while the calculated model results in $U_1 \\approx 260$, which is a change in order of magnitude by about 2. The Partition function for the first ionisation stage , however remain at $U_2 = 1$ for both models. To answer why the partition functions for the two neutral hydrogen models behave so differently at high temperaures, we need to take a look at the expression for the partition function again: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_r = \\sum_{s = 1}^{n} g_{r,s} e^{-\\chi_{r,s}/k_BT}.\n",

    "Now, in the provided model we only have five levels in the neutral stage of hydrogen. Therefore the upper limit of the sum is simply $n=5$, while we have 100 levels in the calculated model giving $n=100$. At temperatures below 10000 K, the exponential factor provides a weight for the $g_{r,s}$'s in such a way that they fall of quickly as $s$ increases, making the first few terms dominant. Since the first terms are the same in both models the sum will of course be close to equal. If we look at high temperaures, like 20000 K or more, $e^{-\\chi_{r,s}/k_BT}\\to 1$ because the $\\chi_{r,s}$'s can at most approach 13.598 eV (ionisation energy of hydrogen), while the temperaure is high. We therefore lose the temperature dependence at high $T$, so that $U_r\\to\\sum_s g_{r,s}$. Because we have 5 elements in the provided model and 100 elements in the calculated model, it is no wonder that the calculated model results in a higher partition function for high temperatures. Therewhile, since we in both models only have one level for the ionisation state of hydrogen, the partition function for each model will always be equal, for any temperaure. "

    "If we assume Paynes assumption is true, the relative line strength of Ca$^+$ K with respect to the H$\\alpha$ line should scale about propotionally to the ration between the populations of the lower level of the two transitions. However, we also need to take the abundance ratio into account, as there is way more hydrogen in the Sun than Ca. The relative line strength is the ratio between the total number of Ca and H; $\\frac{n_{Ca^+K}N_{Ca}}{n_{H\\alpha}N_{H}} = \\frac{n_{Ca^+K}}{n_{H\\alpha}} \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^{-6}$, where we multiply each lower level population with the total number density of the corresponding atom to transform the populations fraction into a total number fraction. Now, we see that this realtive line strength will depend strongly on the population ratio. For the Ca$^+$ K line to be stronger than the $H\\alpha$ line we thus need $\\frac{n_{Ca^+K}N_{Ca}}{n_{H\\alpha}N_{H}} > 1$, which happens if the population fraction is greater than the inverse relative abundance $2\\cdot10^{6}$. The population fraction $\\frac{n_{Ca^+K}}{n_{H\\alpha}}$ will actually be very large. That is due to Ca I having a relatively low ionisation energy, making a lot of the Ca atoms ionised to the first ionisation stage due to the relatively high temperatures $4000-6000$ K. Since the Ca$^+$ K line is a ground state transition having a relatvely high population, while H$\\alpha$ is an exitation transition with a relatively low population, the population fraction  of the two latter will be very large. Thus the Ca$^+$ K line is stronger than the H$\\alpha$ line."

If in addition to that look at the second plot, showing the realtive population (normalized by each lines maximum) of each lines, we see that the dips in the first plot seem to correspond to the peak of the two curves. Seen from each peak we see that the graphs have a positive slope when approaching the peak from the right and a negative slope when going from the peak and towards higher temperatures. Thus the change in population $\\Delta n<0$ to the right of the peak and thus the dip in the population change plot and similarly the change $\\Delta n> 0$ to the left of the peak/dip."

    "The reason the relative population is growing quite rapidly before the dips/peaks is that exitation becomes more and more likely for increasing temperature. However, since the slope of the relative population deacreases when approaching the peak, the sensitivety plot decreases. At some point we reach the peak of the relative population, making $n_i/n_{max} = 1$ as large as it can be, while the slope flattens completely out. Thus the sensitivety $\\frac{1}{n_i}\\frac{\\Delta n}{\\Delta T}$ becomes very small fast, resulting in a dip in the sensitivety plot. Thereafter the relative population deacreases very slowly, making the slope dependent sensitivety plot almost flatten out. \n",

    "The reason we get dips in the sensitivety plot at the same temperature as we get peaks in the population plot, is due to ionisation suddenly becoming dominant. As meansion earlier, when increasing the temperature exitation becomes more likely, however, at some point more and more ionisation will happen until there is more ionised atoms than neutral atoms. At the temperature where there is about as much ions as neutral atoms, the population of the neutral atoms in exited states will be at their maximum, as more exited atoms are ionised thus stopping the increase of the population of exited atoms. Thereafter the exited atom fraction will slowly decrease as ionisation fully takes over and the neutral stages become fully depleted."

Thus the incident and exident rays have essentially equal intensity. Since the light passes through the slab almost unchanged we call the slab optically thin.

Also if radiation is emmited due to blackbody radiation inside the slab itself, the radiation does not reach the surface since it is absorbed before reaching out. Thus the only part of the slab contributing to the emergent ray's intensity $I_\\lambda$ is the blackbody radiation $B_\\lambda$ at the very surface of the slab. The slab is then totally opaque, since all radiation from behind is extinct, making the only radiation recieved behind the slab equal to the surface of the slab's blackbody (in our case being source) function; $I_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$.

    "The reason the curves for $\\tau(0)\\ll1$ are so flat (and in some cases almost constant) is that a low $\\tau(0)$ means a low absorbtion for dimensionless wavelength $u=0$. The smaller $\\tau(0)$ is, the less radiation is absorbed at $u=0$, making the bottom of the line profile less deep. Letting almost all radiation at $u=0$ passes the reversing layer making it radiatively thin. \n",

    "For $\\tau(0)\\gg1$ there is a low-intensity saturation limit, due to the layer now being optically thick, not letting the radiation at $u=0$ through the reversing layer. Thus the only radiation recieved at a detector would originate from blackbody radiation on the layer's surface, giving a lower intensity limit equal to the source function $S_\\lambda = B_\\lambda(T_{layer})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to why the emergent line-profile develops wings only at large $\\tau(0)$ we need to consider the expression for $I_\\lambda$. Due to $\\tau(u) = \\tau(0)V(a,u)$, the line profile is a mix between a Lorentzian and Gaussian formed dip due to the Voigt function $V(a,u)$. When increasing $\\tau(0)$ the bottom of the line-profile at some point hits the saturation limit suppressing the Gaussian part (centre region of the Voigt formed line profile) of the curve. Therewhile the Lorentzian part of $\\tau$ still grows making the wing section (which never end since the wings converge to the surface intensity $I_\\lambda = B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$) of the line profile deepen. \n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the three curves where $\\tau(0)$ is the biggest, meaning $\\tau(0) = 100$, $\\tau(0) \\approx 30$ and $\\tau(0) = 10$ the line is saturated at $u=0$, making it optically thick (see plot above). And similarly the lower values for $\\tau(0)$ make the line profile flatten out, making the intensity unchanged at the line centre $ I_\\lambda(0) \\approx B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$, resulting in an optical thin layer. This happens at for instance $\\tau(0) = 0.01$ and $\\tau(0) \\approx 0.03$ in the plot above. Anything in between saturation and a flattened curve is not strictily one or the other, but something in between (there is a smooth transition into each case of thickness). We see that at $u=5$ there is no saturated line profile. Thus to get an optically thick layer at $u=5$ we need to try even higher values for $\\tau(0)$ than the ones tested to reach saturation. However, most of the curves are quite flat an approximatelly equal to $B(T_{surface})$ thus letting the radiation through almost unchanged. The layer is thus quite optically thin at $u=5$ for most chosen $\\tau(0)$."

    "Next we calculate emergent line profiles unsing the same range of $\\tau(0)$ as in the previous point (`tau0 = 10 ** numpy.linspace(-2, 2, 9)`) but for several different wavelengths $\\lambda = 100, 200, 500, 1000$ nm. Since we know that the incident intensity equals the sourse function of the star's surface, being the Planck function $B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$ in this case, the incoming intensity is dependent on the surface temperature $T_{surface}$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$. Similarly, the bottom saturation limit on $I_\\lambda$ is equal to the Planck function of the surface of the isothermal layer $B_\\lambda(T_{layer})$, being determined by the layers temperature $T_{layer}$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$. To check whether this is true we compare $I_{cont}$ (the very first array element of $I_\\lambda$) to $B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$ and $I_(0)$ (the minimum value of a saturated line profile) to $B_\\lambda(T_{layer})$ for each wavelength while holding the two temperatures constant. The above script cell prints out these vaues, which appear to confirm our hypothisis. Thus when plotting the calculated $B_\\lambda$ for a wavelength range and both temperatures, we should thus get back a blackbody spectrum. This is seen in the script cell below, where we see that the wavelengths used do in fact make the two intensities match the blackbody curves of the star surface and isothermal layer respectively. \n",

    "We also plot the emergent line profiles for the said $\\tau(0)$ range for the wavelengths 200, 500 and 1000 nm and normalize the curves by their corresponding continoum intensity $I_{const}$. This is seen in the plot produced by the above code cell. In the plot the red, blue and green curves correspond to the emergent line profiles for wavelengths 200, 500 and 1000 nm respectively. One can clearly see that the distance between the continuum intensity $I_{cont}$ and the lower saturation level $I(0)$ in relative units units is greater for lower wavelengths. Also it is important to note that the continuum intensity and the saturation level intensity are different for each of the three wavelengths, but appear at the same place in the plot due to thir respective normalisation.

    "When plotting the curve off growth using the provided code (see below code cell), we can clearly see three different regimes in the graph; first a linear like graph with slope 1:1 followed by a bend in the middle, and last another linear like graph with slope 1:2. Since the slope of the curve of growth illustrates how much the area covered by the emergent line profile changes when changing $\\tau(0)$, the linear like slope 1:1 in the first part of the curve of growth suggests that the area covered by the emergent line profile grows $\\propto \\tau(0)$. This is similar to the linearity in $I_\\lambda$ observed for $\\tau\\ll 1$ in Sec. 2.2 earlier. When the emergent line profile hits the saturation limit the area covered by the line profile stops growing $\\propto \\tau(0)$ and slows down due to the larger gaussian central part of the line profile being suppressed. This slow down corresponds to the flattening in the second section of the curve of growth. When further increasing $\\tau(0)$ the equivalent width again starts growing linear-like in the log-scale plot due to the now developing wing section of the line profile. However the growth is somewhat slower than in the first part, hence the slope of 1:2. One can see these behaviours quite easily by simply plotting the line profile and tweeking $\\tau(0)$ back and forth and see how the area covered by the line responds to these changes."

Changing the emergent line profies width of course changes its area and thus the equivalent width in the curve of growth. In order to estimate the parameter $a$ for the solar iron lines in Wright's (1948), we plot several curves of growth for different parameter values in the range $a\\in(0.01, 0.5)$. This is done in the code cell below. We then estimate by eye which parameter makes the curve of growth fit Wright's work the best. We found that a parameter $a\\in(0.01, 0.033)$ seems to make the best fit. However, this is just a rough initial estimate, as we need to do a proper curve fit to determain $a$ to a higher precision. Below the curve of growths for $a\\in(0.01, 0.1)$ are plotted to illustrate our best fit paramter choices."

This is due to the area covered by the line profile (the equivalent width) being equally sensitive to changes in $\\tau(0)$ for an absorption and emission line, since the two cases behave symmertrically around the intensity limit set by the sourse function of the reversing layer's surface.
