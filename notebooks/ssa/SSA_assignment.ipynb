You can also modify the header below to suit your needs, but please don't use any non-standard packages and do not load external code. The whole notebook must run without any errors in the code. In this first experiment with notebooks, there are no page / text limits. But please write concisely, and try to keep it short!*"

Also we see that He, only having three stages; He I, He II and HeIII, has all its possible stages represented. Therewhile the Ca atom only shows six (Ca I - Ca V) of its 21 possible stages (which are probably quite hard to find when searching for the higher stages). Another difference to note is that it seems as if He II reaches its population peak at arround 25 kK, while at the same temperature Ca III also reaches its population peak. This may suggest that it is a bit easier to ionize Ca one stage higher than it is to ionize He to the same stage."

    "If we calculate and compare the partition functions $U_r$ for the provided Hydrogen atom model data in `H_atom.txt` and the calculated 100-level Hydrogen atom model saved in the `H_model.dat`-file, we see that they behave quite similar for low temperatures. At low temperatures (5000 K) both $U_1 = 2$ and $U_2 = 1$. for each model. However, when incrreasing the temperature to 10000 K we start to notice that $U_1$ remains close to $U_1 \\approx 2$ for the provided model and approaches $U_1 = 2.1$ for the calculated level 100-level model. Increasing the temperature even more to 20000 K, we see the differences become very evident. Now the partition function $U_1 \\approx 2.1$ for the provided model, while the calculated model results in $U_1 \\approx 260$, which is a change in order of magnitude by about 2. The Partition function for the first ionisation stage , however remain at $U_2 = 1$ for both models. To answer why the partition functions for the two neutral hydrogen models behave so differently at high temperaures, we need to take a look at the expression for the partition function again \n",

    "Now, in the provided model we only have five levels in the neutral stage of hydtrogen. Therefore the upper limit of the sum is simply $n=5$, while we have 100 levels in the calculated model giving $n=100$. At temperatures below 10000 K, the exponential factor provides a weight for the $g_{r,s}$'s in such a way that they fall of quickly as $s$ increases, making the first few terms dominant. Since the first terms are the same in both models the sum will of course be close to equal. If we look at high temperaures, like 20000 K or more, $e^{-\\chi_{r,s}/k_BT}\\to 1$ because the $\\chi_{r,s}$'s can at most approach 13.598 eV while the temperaure is still high. As also discussed earlier we loose the temperature dependence at high $T$, so that $U_r\\to\\sum_s g_{r,s}$. Because we have 5 elements in the provided model and 100 elements in the calculated model, it is no wonder that the calculated model results in a higher partition function for high temperatures. Therewhile, since we in bth models only have one level for the ionisation state of hydrogen, the partition function for each model will always be equal, for any temperaure. "

That is because not much is absorbed by the slab since $\\tau\\ll1$ and since $I_\\lambda>B_\\lambda$ not much is added due to blackbody radiation in the slab. Thus the incident and exident rays have essentially equal intensity. This is the reason this case is called Optically thin, since the light passing through the medium does not change in intensity much (or at all).

That is because the optical thickness is defined in such a case that $\\tau = 1$ corresponds to the emergant ray being reduced in intensity by a factor $1/e$. So if $\\tau\\gg$, a lot of intencity of the insident ray is lost, essentially being totally extinguished. Also if radiation is emmited due to blackbody radiation inside the slab itself, the radiation does not reach the surface since it is absorbed before reaching out. Thus the only part of the slab contributing to the emergent ray's intensity $I_\\lambda$ is the blackbody radiation at the very surface of the slab. The intensity $I_\\lambda = B_\\lambda$ at the surface in such an optically thick case. One way one can see this is to take a look at the plot corresponding the first point (question) in this section. We see that when following the all graphs towards increasing $\\tau$ the intensity gradually drops to a constant value of $B_\\lambda = 2$ being the blackbody radiation from the slabs surface, thus losing its dependence on $\\tau$ when it is large. The intensity can never drop bellow the source funtion of the slab's surface, in this case being $B_\\lambda$."

When increasing $\\tau(0)$ the bottom of the line-profile at some point hits the saturation limit suppressing the Gaussian part of the curve. Therewhile the Lorentzian part of $\\tau$ still grows making the wing section of the line profile deepen.

And similarly the lower values for $\\tau(0)$ make the line-profile flatten out, making the intensity at the line centre $I_\\lambda \\approx I_\\lambda(0)$, resulting in an optical thin layer. This happens at $\\tau(0) = 0.01$ and $\\tau(0) \\approx 0.03$ in the plot. Anything in between saturation and a flattened curve is not strictily one or the other. We see that at $u=5$ there is no saturation resulting in an optically thick case for this wavelength, however there are curves for lower half $\\tau(0)$'s that result in an essentially flat curve here, making it optically thin."

    "Next we calculate emergent line profiles unsing the same range of $\\tau(0)$ as in the previous point (`tau0 = 10 ** numpy.linspace(-2, 2, 9)`) but for several different wavelengths $\\lambda = 100, 200, 500, 1000$ nm. Now the question is which parameters set the value of the top intensity $I_{cont}$ value and the lower saturation intensity level $I(0)$. Since we know that the incident intensity equals the sourse function of the star's surface, being the Planck function $B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$ in this case, the incoming intensity is dependent on the surface temperature $T_{surface}$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$. Similarly the bottom limit on $I_\\lambda$ is equal to the Planck function of the surface of the isothermal layer $B_\\lambda(T_{layer})$, being determined by the layers temperature $T_{layer}$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$. To check whether this is true we compare $I_{cont}$ (the very first array element of $I_\\lambda$) to $B_\\lambda(T_{surface})$ and $I_(0)$ (the minimum value of a saturated line profile) to $B__\\lambda(T_{layer})$ for each wavelength while holding the two temperatures constant. The above script cell prints out these vaues, which appear to confirm our hypothisis. Thus when plotting the calculated $B_\\lambda$ for a wavelength range and both temperatures, we should thus get back a blackbody spectrum. This is seen in the script cell below, where we see that the wavelengths used do in fact match the blackbody curves of the star surface and isothermal layer respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also plot the emergent line profiles for the said $\\tau(0)$ range for the wavelengths 200, 500 and 1000 nm and normalize the curves by their corresponding continoum intensity $I_{const}$. This is seen in the plot produced by the above code cell. In the plot the red, blue and green curves correspond to the emergent line profiles for wavelengths 200, 500 and 1000 nm respectively. "
